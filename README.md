#1-Implementing Classes, Methods, and Encapsulation for Organized Code:

The system is structured using classes to represent key entities like cars, customers, and rentals. Methods within these classes handle specific behaviors, ensuring the code is organized and easy to manage. Encapsulation is used to protect data and maintain a clean interface.

#2-Applying Inheritance and Polymorphism to Create a Versatile Car Inventory:

Inheritance allows the creation of a hierarchy of car types (e.g., economy, luxury, SUV) that share common characteristics while also having unique features. Polymorphism enables the system to handle different car types seamlessly, making the inventory adaptable and scalable.

#3-Crafting a User-Friendly Console Interface for Renting and Returning Cars:

A simple and intuitive console interface is designed to interact with users, allowing them to rent and return cars effortlessly. The interface guides users through the process, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience.

#4-Calculating Rental Prices Based on Different Car Types and Durations:

The system calculates rental costs by considering the type of car and the rental duration. This dynamic pricing ensures that users are charged appropriately, reflecting the car's value and the length of the rental period.

#5-Efficiently Managing Customers, Cars, and Rentals in the System:

The system maintains a well-organized record of customers, available cars, and active rentals. It efficiently tracks the status of each car, ensuring availability and preventing conflicts. This management ensures smooth operation and enhances user satisfaction.
